# API I/O   - I/O done by the pyRTOS API has completed.
#             This blocking should be automatic, but API
#             functions may want to provide a timeout
#             arguement.
# API Defined

# UFunction - A user provided function that returns true
#             or false, allowing for complex, user defined
#             conditions.
#
#             UFunctions must be infinite generators.  They can
#             take take any initial arguments, but they must
#             must yield False if the condition is not met and
#             True if it is.  Arguments may be passed into the
#             generator iterations, but pyRTOS should not be
#             expected to pass arguments in when checking. In
#             most cases, it would probably be better to
#             communicate with Ufunctions through globals.
# User Defined


# Blocking is achieved by yielding with a list argument.  Each time pyRTOS
# tests the task for readiness, it will iterate through the list, running
# each generator function, checking the truth value of its output.  If the
# truth value of any element of the list is true, the task will unblock.
# This allows for conditions to effectively be "ORed" together, such that it
# is trivial to add a timeout to any other condition.  If you need to "AND"
# conditions together, write a UFunction that takes a list of conditions and
# yields the ANDed output of those conditions.
