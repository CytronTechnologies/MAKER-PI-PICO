# Examples for Internet of Things (IoT)
This folder shows a few examples for IoT applications.

## Required Hardware:
1. [Cytron Maker Pi Pico](https://www.cytron.io/p-maker-pi-pico) or [Cytron Maker Pi RP2040](https://www.cytron.io/p-maker-pi-rp2040)
2. ESP8266 WiFi module (eg: ESP-01, ESP-12F, WROOM-02) with ESP-AT Firmware v2.2.0 and above.<br>
   Latest firmware can be downloaded from [https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/esp-at-binaries](https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/esp-at-binaries).
   
   Follow [these steps](https://www.elec-cafe.com/esp8266-esp-01-firmware-update/) to update the firmware of the ESP-01.<br>
   \* Ignore the error message "Failed to leave Flash mode" at the end of flashing because the GP0 is hardwired to GND.<br>
   \* Use baudrate of 115200 to test out the AT Commands instead of 9600 (Old firmware) as mentioned in the tutorial.

## Dependencies:
We've already included the following dependencies in the lib folder:
- adafruit_espatcontrol
- adafruit_requests.mpy
- adafruit_minimqtt
- adafruit_io

For latest version, you may download it from https://circuitpython.org/libraries

## Instructions:
1. Copy the lib folder to the CIRCUITPY device.
2. Modify the keys in secrets.py and copy it to the CIRCUITPY device.
3. Make sure the UART pins are defined correctly in the example code according to your hardware.

## Examples:
### Adafruit IO
1. Control on-board LED through "led" feed.
2. Reads Pico internal CPU temperature and sends it to Adafruit IO through "temperature" feed.

This example requires the ssid, password, aio_username and aio_key to be specified in the secrets.py.<br>
Refer [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/quickstart-rp2040-pico-with-wifi-and-circuitpython/usage-with-adafruit-io) to learn how to setup the Adafruit IO.

### Blynk
1. Control LED GP0 on Maker Pi Pico using the Button Widget in the Blynk App via virtual pin V0.
2. Use the Button GP20 on Maker Pi Pico to control the LED Widget in the Blynk App via virtual pin V1.

This example requires the ssid, password and blynk_auth_token to be specified in the secrets.py.<br>
Follow [this video](https://youtu.be/UBQCaxfeBKY?t=93) to learn how to setup the Blynk app and get your auth token (Please ignore the part about Arduino IDE).

### Simple Test
Scan for available WiFi AP, connect to the speicifed AP and ping the Google DNS (8.8.8.8).<br>
This is modified from Adafruit's esp_atcontrol_simpletest.py.<br>
<br>
This example requires the ssid and password to be specified in the secrets.py.

### Telegram
Send a message to the Telegram via Telegram Bot.<br>
<br>
This example requires the ssid, password, telegram_bot_token and telegram_chat_id to be specified in the secrets.py.<br>
\* Follow [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) or [this video](https://youtu.be/dqk77sUgZKs?t=36) to learn how to create a telegram bot and get your telegram_bot_token.<br>
\* To get your chat ID, send a private message to your newly created bot, or add your bot to a group and send a message to that group, then use [this tool](https://sean-bradley.medium.com/get-telegram-chat-id-80b575520659) to get your chat ID.

### Thingspeak
Send the value of a counter to Thingspeak every 20 seconds.<br>
The counter value increase by one every iteration.<br>
<br>
This example requires the ssid, password and thingspeak_write_api_key to be specified in the secrets.py.<br>
Follow [this tutorial (Under "CONNECTING TO WEB SERVICES")](https://tutorial.cytron.io/2016/12/16/thingspeak-store-display-digital-compass-data-web-services-espresso-lite-v2-0/) on how to get the Thingspeak Write API Key.
