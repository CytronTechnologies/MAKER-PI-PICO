
# FreeRTOS states are
#
# Running - Currently executing
# Ready - Ready to run but task of higher or equal priority is currently in Running state
# Blocked - Task is waiting for some event, for example, a delay
#           Other reasons for blocks include waiting for a queue, semaphore, or message.
# Suspended - Task was explicitly suspended and will only be resumed by another task.

# For Blocked states, some condition must be met to unblock.  Is it possible that this
# condition could be represented as a function that is called on the task object, that
# will return True if the condition is met?  This would allow the construction of
# lamba or inner functions, that have built in references to any data required to
# determine whether the unblocking condition is met.

# See https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-task-states.html for state transition graph


# Task states
RUNNING   = 0   # Currently executing on the processor
READY     = 1   # Ready to run but task of higher or equal priority is currently running
BLOCKED   = 2   # Task is waiting for some condition to be met to move to READY state
SUSPENDED = 3   # Task is waiting for some other task to unsuspend
				# Why do we need this, since BLOCKED could be used? Creating an
				# unblocking condition for this would require the API to know
				# that the condition is a suspension, and if it already knows
				# it is a suspension, it can just remove it, instead of running
				# the test function.  Thus there is no point in having a
				# function and we might as well just use a flag, since it is
				# cheaper.
